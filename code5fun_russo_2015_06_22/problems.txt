A. Implement a function that returns the intersection of two sorted arrays, assuming numbers in
	each array are unique and array lengths can be different.
	For example, given the two sorted arrays {1, 14, 7, 20, 33} and {1, 32, 51, 7, 99}, the function
	should return the intersection array {1, 7}.

B. Without using framework provided methods such as Count, Getlem or similar, write a method
	which would return the Nth element from the end of a generic type singly linked list, in one
	pass.
	The method will take 2 parameters:
	-> the index N from the end of the list
	-> the generic singly linked list
	For example, given N = 5 and the list of integers {82, 55, 78, 92, 12, 44, 51}, the method
	should return 78.
